# Evaluating-Regression-Model-Performance
Here, we compare the performances of Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression.
To execute, run these individual files on your python compiler and use the correct name of the dataset (either the one uploaded or a dataset of your preference) while importing it.
R Squared Metric is used for evaluation.

What Is R-squared?

R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression.

The definition of R-squared is fairly straight-forward; it is the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model. Or:

R-squared = Explained variation / Total variation

R-squared is always between 0 and 100%:

0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.
100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.
In general, the higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data. However, there are important conditions for this guideline that Iâ€™ll talk about both in this post and my next post.
